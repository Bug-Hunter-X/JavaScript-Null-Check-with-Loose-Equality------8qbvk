This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving loose equality (==) when checking for null or undefined values. The file `bug.js` contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using strict equality (===).  Loose equality can lead to unexpected behavior due to type coercion.  Always use strict equality (===) for reliable null and undefined checks.
